Advanced Data Science for Public Policy - Final Project

The GitHub Page for this respository can be found here:https://aliciahelfrich.github.io/finalproject. 

This repository contains files used to conduct our analysis for the final project. Our project focused on the topic of health insurance loss to inform policymakers where to best utilize resources meant to address uninsurance. 

We developed a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood that someone may lose health insurance over the course of the year. Based on available literature and subject matter expertise, we know that uninsurance can be associated with characteristics such as geography, employment status, wealth, and demographics. Therefore, much of our analysis focused on high-quality datasets that contained some of these useful predictors.

Advanced Data Science for Public Policy - Final Project

Project Overview

Introduction

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, increased access to health insurance coverage for over 20 million Americans. Yet in 2022, over 25 million Americans still did not have health insurance. Being uninsured has been shown to lead to poorer health outcomes, limited preventative care, and increased risk of mortality. Uninsurance is also associated with poor economic outcomes and increases general costs for employers, taxpayers, health systems, and the general public. For example, uncompensated care for those without insurance averaged over $42 billion between 2015 and 2017.

Losing insurance can happen for a multitude of reasons, such as job loss or a change in eligibility for public insurance programs. However, getting people re-enrolled in insurance can be difficult due to lack of knowledge of available programs and financial assistance, high cost of insurance, and availability (e.g. coverage offered through employment). Due to the high social and economic costs associated with being uninsured, state and federal governments, non-profit organizations, and other interested stakeholders have launched campaigns to raise awareness on financial assistance programs, tax credits, state-based Marketplace exchanges, and Medicaid eligibility. Given that the uninsured population is made up of over 25 million people, targeting campaigns can save taxpayer dollars and increase the effectiveness of the programs.

Given the negative consequences of insurances loss and the costs associated with re-enrolling individuals in insurance, we sought to develop a predictive model that would assist government in targeting and anticipating individuals that may be most as risk of losing their insurance. If effective, such a predictive model can help state and federal policymakers and other interested stakeholders target outreach and enrollment activities.

Methodology

We developed a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood that someone may lose health insurance over the course of the year. Based on available literature and subject matter expertise, we know that uninsurance can be associated with characteristics such as geography, employment status, wealth, and demographics. Therefore, much of our analysis focused on high-quality datasets that contained some of these useful predictors.
